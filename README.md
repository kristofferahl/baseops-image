# baseops-shell

Base of operations. A lightweight DevOps image based on alpine.

- Lightweight (only the bare essentials)
- Opinionated, glamourous prompt
- Extendable

Heavily inspired by the awesome [geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) project. If your need a bigger toolset with all the bells and whistles, geodesic is a better choise.
