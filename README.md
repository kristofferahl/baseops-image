# baseops-image

Base of operations. A lightweight DevOps image based on alpine.

- Lightweight (only the bare essentials)
- Opinionated shell, glamourous prompt
- Extendable

Docker Image: [kristofferahl/baseops](https://hub.docker.com/r/kristofferahl/baseops)

Heavily inspired by the awesome [geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) project. If your need a bigger toolset with all the bells and whistles, geodesic is a better choise.
